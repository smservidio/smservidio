Hi! I'm Samantha.

Thanks for stopping by! I'm breaking into the tech industry and am currently seeking an entry-level role surrounding or adjacent to Business Intelligence Analytics. As a versatile professional with a background in operations, client service, and data-driven decision-making, I have a proven track record of optimizing processes, analyzing trends, and enhancing performance across real estate, hospitality, and executive support roles. Iâ€™ve held diverse roles that showcase my adaptability and transferable skills. I'm excited for the opportunity to expand upon my diverse experience with a new path in the tech industry.

My professional hard technical skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, and coding with platforms such as Tableau and SQL. Previous roles have given me strong proficiency in FMLS, GAMLS, content creation, residential purchase and lease procurement, and lease management.

Outside of work, I'm a mom to a six-year-old and love spending time with him. I also enjoy kickboxing, hot yoga, watersports, snowboarding, hiking, cooking, attending community festivals, and discovering new rooftops and restaurants.

Feel free to contact me on my GitHub page, or via LinkedIn. I look forward to connecting with you!
